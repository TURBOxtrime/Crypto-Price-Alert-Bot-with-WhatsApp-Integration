## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Reads a list of cryptocurrency symbols and thresholds (`lowest`, `highest`) from a Google Sheet via Sheety.
2. Fetches current prices using CoinMarketCap API.
3. Compares each coin's price to its thresholds:
   - If above `lowest` ‚Üí send **"ready to sell"** alert.
   - If below `highest` ‚Üí send **"ready to buy"** alert.
4. Sends the alert message via Twilio to a WhatsApp number.
